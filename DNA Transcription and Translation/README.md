### **Summary of the "DNA Transcription & Translation" Ruleflow Project**  

#### **Use Case**  
This ruleflow models **DNA transcription and protein synthesis** by simulating the processes of **messenger RNA (mRNA) translation by ribosomes** and **transfer RNA (tRNA) codon matching**. It follows the biological mechanisms where genetic information is **converted into proteins** based on a set of codon-to-amino acid rules.

### **Key Decision Points**  

#### **1. mRNA Translation by Ribosomes (Ribosome Ruleflow)**  
- **Ribosome Attachment:**  
  - A ribosome attaches to an mRNA strand **only if fewer than 3 ribosomes** are currently processing the strand.  
- **Codon Processing:**  
  - The ribosome reads **three nucleotides (a codon) at a time**.  
  - It matches the codon to a corresponding **tRNA molecule**.  
  - The **amino acid abbreviation and symbol** are added to the growing protein chain.  
- **Handling Stop Codons:**  
  - If the codon is **UAA, UAG, or UGA**, the ribosome **detaches**, and the completed **protein sequence is stored**.

#### **2. tRNA Assembly & Amino Acid Assignment (tRNA Ruleflow)**  
- **Codon-Anticodon Pairing:**  
  - Each tRNA molecule is assigned a **codon (3 nucleotides)** and an **anticodon (complementary nucleotides)**.  
- **Amino Acid Mapping:**  
  - Each codon corresponds to a **specific amino acid** (e.g., **AUG → Methionine (M)**, **UUU → Phenylalanine (F)**).  
  - **Stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) terminate translation.**

### **Biological and Computational Alignment**  
- **Iterative Processing of mRNA:** Simulates **ribosome movement along the mRNA strand** in increments of 3 bases.  
- **Fuzzy Matching with Codon-Anticodon Pairs:** Ensures **tRNA molecules correctly bind to mRNA codons**.  
- **Dynamic Protein Chain Assembly:** Builds **protein sequences step by step**, reflecting **real cellular translation**.
