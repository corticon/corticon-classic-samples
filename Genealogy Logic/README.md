### **Hierarchy Traversal**  

#### **Use Case**  
This ruleflow models **family relationships** by analyzing a **genealogical hierarchy**. It determines **family relationships, generations, and ancestry connections** based on parent-child linkages.  

---

### **Key Decision Points**  

#### **1. Counting Descendants**  
- Calculates the **number of children** and **total descendants** for each person in the hierarchy.  
- Accumulates descendant counts recursively across generations.  

#### **2. Identifying Siblings**  
- Finds individuals who **share the same parent**, identifying **siblings**.  

#### **3. Determining Generational Relationships**  
- Computes the **difference in generations** between two individuals.  
- Assigns relationship labels based on generational distance:  
  - 0 generations apart → Same person  
  - 1 generation apart → Parent and Child  
  - 2 generations apart → Grandparent and Grandchild  
  - More than 2 generations apart → Great-grandparent or Great-grandchild with counted "greats"  

#### **4. Finding Closest Common Ancestor**  
- Determines the closest shared ancestor between two individuals.  
- Helps classify relationships such as **cousins, aunts, and uncles**.  

#### **5. Defining Family Relationship Types**  
-  Siblings (1 generation apart, same ancestor) 
- Aunt/Uncle and Niece/Nephew (1 generation apart, different ancestor levels) 
- Cousins (2+ generations apart, same ancestor level)
- Removed cousins (when one cousin is from a different generation than the other)

### **Iterative Processing in Corticon for Hierarchy Traversal**  

#### **Concepts Involved**  

1. **Iterative Processing in Corticon**  
   - The **"iterative"** option in Corticon allows a rule to execute multiple times within the same rule execution cycle, effectively looping until a condition is met or all entities are processed.  
   - This differs from standard rule execution, where each rule runs **once per applicable entity per rule cycle**.  
   - Iterative rules are useful for scenarios where **a value must be accumulated or a hierarchy must be traversed dynamically**.  

2. **The `->next` Operator**  
   - The **`->next`** operator is a **collection navigation operator** in Corticon.  
   - It is used to iterate through ordered collections, moving from one entity to the next in a sequence.  
   - It is commonly used in **linked lists, hierarchical structures, or ordered data sets**.  

3. **Incrementing an Integer in an Iterative Rule**  
   - When used with an integer (such as a **generation count**), iteration allows the integer to be **incremented dynamically** during execution.  
   - This technique is often used to track **cumulative counts** (e.g., **generation numbers in a family tree**).

### **How Corticon Applies These Concepts in This Ruleflow**  

#### **1. First Rulesheet: `Count_Descendants` (Using `->next` and Iterative Processing)**  
- **Goal:** Count the **number of descendants** of a person by iterating through the hierarchy.  
- **Logic:**
  - `p.numberOfChildren = kid->size` → Counts the **direct children** of a person.  
  - `p.numberOfDescendants = p.numberOfChildren` → Starts with the **direct children count**.  
  - `p.numberOfDescendants += kid.numberOfDescendants` → Adds **children's descendants recursively**.  
- **Why Iteration is Needed:**  
  - Since descendants can have **their own descendants**, an **iterative rule ensures** all levels of the hierarchy are traversed.  
  - The `->next` operator **steps through** child entities dynamically.  

#### **2. Third Rulesheet: `Determine_Generation` (Incrementing an Integer with Iteration)**  
- **Goal:** Assign a **generation number** to each individual.  
- **Logic:**  
  - If a person **has no parent**, they are **generation 1**.  
  - If they **have a parent**, their generation is `ancestor.generation + 1`.  
- **Why Iteration is Needed:**  
  - Since **generation numbers are dependent on parents' generation values**, iteration ensures each person's generation is calculated **only after their parent’s generation is assigned**.  
  - The rule iterates through each level of the tree, **incrementing the generation number dynamically**.

### **How This Works for the Use Case**  

In the **genealogy hierarchy**, **iteration ensures that family relationships propagate correctly**:

1. **Counting Descendants (`Count_Descendants`)**
   - Iterates through **each child-parent relationship**.  
   - **Accumulates** descendant counts recursively.  

2. **Assigning Generations (`Determine_Generation`)**
   - Iterates through **each person** and assigns **a generation number relative to their parent**.  
   - Ensures that no person is assigned a generation **before their ancestor's generation is known**.  

By using **iterative processing**, Corticon ensures that both descendant counts and generational numbers **propagate correctly across the entire hierarchy**, making it an effective way to process **structured hierarchical data dynamically**.
